# TAMatch
TA Application and Assignment System as a CSCE 431-Singapore 2019 Project


This project aims to serve as a platform for Texas A&M Graduate Students and faculty to
minimize human intervention in  the application process for TA's.

This platform needs to:
-Allow professors to preference TA’s
-Allow TA’s to preference professors or classes
-Allow TA’s to specify which kinds of classes they want / don’t want to teach
-Maximize amount of successful matches between preferred professors/TA’s/classes.
